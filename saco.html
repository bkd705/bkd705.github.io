      <div class="aboutWork">
        <p>I designed the header to be a simplistic header that showed the clients name and title in a way that represented their personality and skills. I also wanted to add some texture to it so I used a grunge resource along with a grunge type face.</p>

        <p>Since this was designed to be for use as a resume, I included a stock picture to show where the clients picture could be and how it would be situated. I also threw the navigation around this as it just felt right.</p>

        <p>I don't really know what I am typing anymore because it is all bullshit. But basically in the end, it isn't even finished, but I am just putting it here to fill in my website.</p>
