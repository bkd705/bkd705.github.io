Welcome back me. I haven't written one of these in a bit, but now, I am learning rails, and I am going to share my experience so far!

I have wanted to stick with JavaScript for a while now, I really want to just dive into the language and actually get to know it really well and I feel like I am actually really starting to become a good JavaScript developer. I can actually notice clever things that people do with their code, and can recognize little quirks people post around and such. I feel comfortable refactoring my code all the time because I am always learning better ways to do it.. buuuutttt, RoR is really cool too.

So what happened? Basically I have had a list of Rails tutorials sitting in my bookmarks forever, and tonight (Sun Jan 8th) I decided I was going to start one of them, the one I am starting is the "Front-End Developer Something Something" course provided by [UpSkill Courses](http://upskillcourses.com). It goes over a whole bunch of crap that I don't care about, but then you dive into Ruby, and then right into building a full SaaS application with Rails. I really like this tutorial because it also goes through how to create the files yourself as well as the schemas and such, rather than just `rails g ...`.

What have I figured out so far? __Rails is actually kind of cool__, _and so is OOP_. I am actually quite surprised as I thought I would actually hate it, and I still really am not a huge fan of it and I keep resorting to my JavaScript defaults when doing stuff, but honestly, the structure of Rails is really nice, and with Rails, everything just magically works together. There is no `import` all over the place or webpack, because the asset pipeline is actually amazing and bundles all your assets for you!

Do I miss JavaScript? __A LOT__ I really don't think I will carry Rails on much longer, the main reason is, I don't have the time right now to sit down and actually get into a whole new language between school work (PHP ew), contract work and side projects I've commited to, and of course, the coolest hackathon in the world üçå. But in the future when I have more time I would love to dive into Rails full on. I just don't like the idea of doing what I did with JavaScript which was learning Node, Express and Mongo, but having no actual idea what JavaScript even was, back then, functional programming, callback functions, asynchronous weren't even words in my vocabulary, I just knew this did that, and it was bad. I don't want to do that with Ruby / On Rails. If I'm going to learn it, I'd rather do it properly and start with Ruby, and then learn Rails, but for now, it is kind of fun to just take a break from JavaScript for a day or two, and build a cool SaaS RoR app!

Welp, sorry for the wall of text, but it is just nice to kind of type some stuff out at 4am when I should be sleeping.
