### What is this going to be?\nI'm not sure really. I've just always really wanted to have a blog and I see pretty much every other big and cool web application developer doing it, so I figured it was my turn since I got $50 free [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) credits from the [Github Education Pack](https://education.github.com). \n\n### I have no idea what I'm doing.\nHow do you even write good blog posts, do I just put headers here and there, or am I supposed to include crazy cool images and diagrams to keep the user interested. Maybe I'll just write satirical posts about a JavaScript framework, or make fun of how CSS is broken and pretend I don't know how to handle the box-model or overflow like every other big web developer with a blog does. Actually, even better, I'll just make myself a medium account, and cross post all my cool posts from here, onto there, and make sure to link back to here and tell people to subscribe to my weekly newsletter that I'll forget about after week two!\n\n### Maybe I should introduce myself\nI am Brennen. I am a 17 year old (almost 18, we're getting there... slowly) student at Georgian College in Barrie, Ontario. I am in the Computer Programmer Analyst program, although so far it has been useless (although it is only the first semester). The problem is, I go on these crazy binges of just finding a new language, tech or framework and just learn it super quick and build as much with it as I can, ie. how I turned myself into a React developer. This sounds like its not a problem, and it is super fun being able to learn about a whole new technology or framework faster than you'd ever learn in school thanks to the vast resources on this thing called the internet, but its sort of a blessing and a curse, as now I've basically taught myself a lot of what I'm going to learn in this program, leaving me bored in class, which leads to me just not going to class which is a bit of a bummer. I realize as I am typing this, I am sounded insanely cocky about it all. I am not some programmer genius, I'm just some kid who doesn't mind staying up all night watching tutorials and rebuilding the same application 4 times to triple check I know how each and every part works and what the best practices are.\n\n### I guess this is it\nI mean, I don't really know what else to type, I'm already at 434 words which is actually quite surprising, it is kind of nice to just type out random crap that comes to my mind, even though I know for atleast the next little while, and probably for a long little while.. (what?) that I will be the only one actually reading any of these. I guess its like a nice way to record what I'm thinking, I have no clue. Anyways, I'll leave some cool stuff at the bottom and a picture of some cats or something.\n\nIf for whatever reason you came here and read this far because you wanted to contact me about some sort of work to do, here is a link to the information you were probably looking for...\n\n- [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/bkd705)\n- [Github](https://github.com/bkd705)\n- [Resume](http://bkd705.com/static/resume.pdf)\n\nAs I promised...\n\n![cute cat thing](https://i.imgur.com/f7oVJ3N.jpg)\n\n ","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h3 id=\"whatisthisgoingtobe\">What is this going to be?</h3>\n\n<p>I'm not sure really.
